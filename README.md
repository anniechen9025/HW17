# 17. NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker

## Description
We had been learning how to use node and Mongo DB to connect database and server. I learn how to structure connection between database and grab the information from Mongo database and the proper way of setting up the MongoDB Schemas. It was challenge to get the information structure out in the models and associated with each other front and back and using route for specific detail into Mongo DB. Over all I enjoy the process of seeing database being edit, add by GET, POST and PUT methods.
